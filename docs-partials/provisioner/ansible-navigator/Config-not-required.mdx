<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in provisioner/ansible-navigator/provisioner.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `command` (string) - The command to invoke ansible-navigator. Defaults to `ansible-navigator`.
  This must be the executable name or path only, without additional arguments.
  Use extra_arguments or play-level options for additional flags.
  Examples: "ansible-navigator", "/usr/local/bin/ansible-navigator", "~/bin/ansible-navigator"

- `ansible_navigator_path` ([]string) - Additional directories to prepend to PATH when locating and running ansible-navigator.
  Entries are HOME-expanded and prepended to PATH during version checks and execution.
  Example: ["~/bin", "/opt/ansible/bin"]

- `keep_going` (bool) - Continue executing remaining plays even if one fails.
  When true, a play failure won't stop execution of subsequent plays.
  Default: false

- `structured_logging` (bool) - Enable structured JSON parsing and detailed task-level reporting.
  When true, parses JSON events from ansible-navigator and provides enhanced error reporting.
  Only effective when navigator_mode is set to "json".

- `log_output_path` (string) - Optional path to write a structured summary JSON file containing task results and failures.
  Only used when structured_logging is enabled.

- `verbose_task_output` (bool) - Include detailed task output in logs when using structured logging.
  Only effective when structured_logging is true.
  Default: false

- `play` ([]Play) - Repeated play blocks supporting both playbooks and role FQDNs

- `requirements_file` (string) - Path to a unified requirements.yml file containing both roles and collections

- `roles_path` (string) - Destination directory for installed roles.
  This value is passed to ansible-galaxy as the roles install path and exported to Ansible via ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH.
  Defaults to ~/.packer.d/ansible_roles_cache if not specified.

- `collections_path` (string) - Destination directory for installed collections.
  This value is passed to ansible-galaxy as the collections install path and exported to Ansible via ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH.
  Defaults to ~/.packer.d/ansible_collections_cache if not specified.

- `offline_mode` (bool) - When true, skip network operations for both collections and roles.
  This maps to ansible-galaxy --offline.

- `galaxy_command` (string) - The ansible-galaxy executable to invoke.
  Defaults to "ansible-galaxy".

- `galaxy_args` ([]string) - Additional arguments appended to all ansible-galaxy invocations.

- `galaxy_force` (bool) - When true, pass --force to ansible-galaxy.
  Ignored if galaxy_force_with_deps is true.

- `groups` ([]string) - The groups into which the Ansible host should
   be placed. When unspecified, the host is not associated with any groups.

- `empty_groups` ([]string) - The groups which should be present in
   inventory file but remain empty.

- `host_alias` (string) - The alias by which the Ansible host should be
  known. Defaults to `default`. This setting is ignored when using a custom
  inventory file.

- `user` (string) - The `ansible_user` to use. Defaults to the user running
   packer, NOT the user set for your communicator. If you want to use the same
   user as the communicator, you will need to manually set it again in this
   field.

- `local_port` (int) - The port on which to attempt to listen for SSH
   connections. This value is a starting point. The provisioner will attempt
   listen for SSH connections on the first available of ten ports, starting at
   `local_port`. A system-chosen port is used when `local_port` is missing or
   empty.

- `ssh_host_key_file` (string) - The SSH key that will be used to run the SSH
   server on the host machine to forward commands to the target machine.
   Ansible connects to this server and will validate the identity of the
   server using the system known_hosts. The default behavior is to generate
   and use a onetime key. Host key checking is disabled via the
   `ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING` environment variable if the key is generated.

- `ssh_authorized_key_file` (string) - The SSH public key of the Ansible
   `ssh_user`. The default behavior is to generate and use a onetime key. If
   this key is generated, the corresponding private key is passed to
   `ansible-playbook` with the `-e ansible_ssh_private_key_file` option.

- `ansible_proxy_key_type` (string) - Change the key type used for the adapter.
  
  Supported values:
  
  * ECDSA (default)
  * RSA
  
  NOTE: using RSA may cause problems if the key is used to authenticate with rsa-sha1
  as modern OpenSSH versions reject this by default as it is unsafe.

- `ansible_proxy_bind_address` (string) - The IP address the SSH proxy should bind to.
  Defaults to "127.0.0.1". Set to "0.0.0.0" to allow external connections
  (e.g. from a container).

- `ansible_proxy_host` (string) - The host address the container should use to connect back to the proxy.
  Defaults to "127.0.0.1". For WSL2/containers, this might be "host.docker.internal"
  or "host.containers.internal".

- `sftp_command` (string) - The command to run on the machine being
   provisioned by Packer to handle the SFTP protocol that Ansible will use to
   transfer files. The command should read and write on stdin and stdout,
   respectively. Defaults to `/usr/lib/sftp-server -e`.

- `skip_version_check` (bool) - Check if ansible-navigator is installed prior to running.
  Set this to `true`, for example, if you're going to install it during the packer run.

- `version_check_timeout` (\*string) - Maximum time to wait for ansible-navigator version check to complete.
  Defaults to "60s". This prevents indefinite hangs when ansible-navigator
  is not properly configured or cannot be found.
  Format: duration string (e.g., "30s", "1m", "90s").
  Set to "0" to disable timeout (not recommended).

- `-` (bool) - Internal: tracks whether version_check_timeout was explicitly provided by the user.
  This allows warning when skip_version_check makes it ineffective.

- `use_sftp` (bool) - Use SFTP

- `inventory_directory` (string) - The directory in which to place the
   temporary generated Ansible inventory file. By default, this is the
   system-specific temporary file location. The fully-qualified name of this
   temporary file will be passed to the `-i` argument of the `ansible` command
   when this provisioner runs ansible. Specify this if you have an existing
   inventory directory with `host_vars` `group_vars` that you would like to
   use in the playbook that this provisioner will run.

- `inventory_file_template` (string) - This template represents the format for the lines added to the temporary
  inventory file that Packer will create to run Ansible against your image.
  The default for recent versions of Ansible is:
  "{{ .HostAlias }} ansible_host={{ .Host }} ansible_user={{ .User }} ansible_port={{ .Port }}\n"
  Available template engines are: This option is a template engine;
  variables available to you include the examples in the default (Host,
  HostAlias, User, Port) as well as any variables available to you via the
  "build" template engine.

- `inventory_file` (string) - The inventory file to use during provisioning.
   When unspecified, Packer will create a temporary inventory file and will
   use the `host_alias`.

- `limit` (string) - Limit playbook execution to specific hosts or groups.
  This corresponds to ansible-playbook's --limit flag.
  Example: "webservers:&production" or "host1,host2"

- `keep_inventory_file` (bool) - If `true`, the Ansible provisioner will
   not delete the temporary inventory file it creates in order to connect to
   the instance. This is useful if you are trying to debug your ansible run
   and using "--on-error=ask" in order to leave your instance running while you
   test your playbook. this option is not used if you set an `inventory_file`.

- `galaxy_force_with_deps` (bool) - Force overwriting an existing role/collection and its dependencies.
   Adds `--force-with-deps` option to `ansible-galaxy` command. By default,
   this is `false`.

- `use_proxy` (boolean) - When `true`, set up a localhost proxy adapter
  so that Ansible has an IP address to connect to, even if your guest does not
  have an IP address. For example, the adapter is necessary for Docker builds
  to use the Ansible provisioner. If you set this option to `false`, but
  Packer cannot find an IP address to connect Ansible to, it will
  automatically set up the adapter anyway.
  
   In order for Ansible to connect properly even when use_proxy is false, you
  need to make sure that you are either providing a valid username and ssh key
  to the ansible provisioner directly, or that the username and ssh key
  being used by the ssh communicator will work for your needs. If you do not
  provide a user to ansible, it will use the user associated with your
  builder, not the user running Packer.
   use_proxy=false is currently only supported for SSH and WinRM.
  
  Currently, this defaults to `true` for all connection types. In the future,
  this option will be changed to default to `false` for SSH and WinRM
  connections where the provisioner has access to a host IP.

- `ansible_winrm_use_http` (bool) - Force WinRM to use HTTP instead of HTTPS.
  
  Set this to true to force Ansible to use HTTP instead of HTTPS to communicate
  over WinRM to the destination host.
  
  Ansible uses the port as a heuristic to determine whether to use HTTP
  or not. In the current state, Packer assigns a random port for connecting
  to WinRM and Ansible's heuristic fails to determine that it should be
  using HTTP, even when the communicator is setup to use it.
  
  Alternatively, you may also directly add the following arguments to the
  `extra_arguments` section for ansible: `"-e", "ansible_winrm_scheme=http"`.
  
  Default: `false`

- `show_extra_vars` (bool) - Display extra vars JSON content in output for debugging.
  When enabled, logs the extra vars JSON passed to ansible-navigator with sensitive values redacted.
  Default: false

- `navigator_config` (\*NavigatorConfig) - Modern declarative ansible-navigator configuration via typed structs.
  When provided, the plugin generates a temporary ansible-navigator.yml file.
  This replaces the previous map[string]interface{} approach to ensure RPC serializability.
  Use block syntax in HCL:
    navigator_config {
      mode = "stdout"
      execution_environment {
        enabled = true
        image = "quay.io/ansible/creator-ee:latest"
      }
    }
