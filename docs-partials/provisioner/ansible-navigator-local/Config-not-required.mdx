<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in provisioner/ansible-navigator-local/provisioner.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `command` (string) - The command to invoke ansible-navigator. Defaults to `ansible-navigator`.
  This must be the executable name or path only, without additional arguments.
  Use extra_arguments or play-level options for additional flags.
  Examples: "ansible-navigator", "/usr/local/bin/ansible-navigator", "~/bin/ansible-navigator"

- `ansible_navigator_path` ([]string) - Additional directories to prepend to PATH when locating and running ansible-navigator on the target.
  Entries are HOME-expanded locally and prepended to PATH in the remote shell command.
  Example: ["~/bin", "/opt/ansible/bin"]

- `version_check_timeout` (\*string) - Maximum time to wait for ansible-navigator version check to complete.
  Defaults to "60s". This prevents indefinite hangs when ansible-navigator
  is not properly configured or cannot be found.
  Format: duration string (e.g., "30s", "1m", "90s").
  Set to "0" to disable timeout (not recommended).

- `-` (bool) - Internal: tracks whether version_check_timeout was explicitly provided by the user.
  This allows warning when skip_version_check makes it ineffective.

- `skip_version_check` (bool) - Check if ansible-navigator is installed prior to running.
  Set this to `true`, for example, if you're going to install it during the packer run.
  Note: the local provisioner does not currently perform a version check, but this is
  kept for configuration parity and for warning when it makes version_check_timeout ineffective.

- `keep_going` (bool) - Modern Ansible Navigator fields (aligned with remote provisioner)
  Continue executing remaining plays even if one fails.
  When true, a play failure won't stop execution of subsequent plays.
  Default: false

- `structured_logging` (bool) - Enable structured JSON parsing and detailed task-level reporting.
  When true, parses JSON events from ansible-navigator and provides enhanced error reporting.
  Only effective when navigator_mode is set to "json".

- `log_output_path` (string) - Optional path to write a structured summary JSON file containing task results and failures.
  Only used when structured_logging is enabled.

- `verbose_task_output` (bool) - Include detailed task output in logs when using structured logging.
  Only effective when structured_logging is true.
  Default: false

- `play` ([]Play) - Array of play definitions supporting both playbooks and role FQDNs.
  Mutually exclusive with playbook_file.

- `requirements_file` (string) - Path to a unified requirements.yml file containing both roles and collections.
  Alternative to galaxy_file with enhanced support for modern Ansible requirements format.

- `roles_path` (string) - Destination directory for installed roles.
  This value is passed to ansible-galaxy as the roles install path and exported to Ansible via ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH.
  Defaults to ~/.packer.d/ansible_roles_cache if not specified.

- `collections_path` (string) - Destination directory for installed collections.
  This value is passed to ansible-galaxy as the collections install path and exported to Ansible via ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATHS.
  Defaults to ~/.packer.d/ansible_collections_cache if not specified.

- `offline_mode` (bool) - When true, skip network operations for both collections and roles.
  This maps to ansible-galaxy --offline.

- `galaxy_command` (string) - The ansible-galaxy executable to invoke.
  Defaults to "ansible-galaxy".

- `galaxy_args` ([]string) - Additional arguments appended to all ansible-galaxy invocations.

- `galaxy_force` (bool) - When true, pass --force to ansible-galaxy.
  Ignored if galaxy_force_with_deps is true.

- `galaxy_force_with_deps` (bool) - When true, pass --force-with-deps to ansible-galaxy.

- `show_extra_vars` (bool) - Display extra vars JSON content in output for debugging.
  When enabled, logs the extra vars JSON passed to ansible-navigator with sensitive values redacted.
  Default: false

- `navigator_config` (\*NavigatorConfig) - Modern declarative ansible-navigator configuration via YAML file generation.
  Maps directly to ansible-navigator.yml schema structure.
  Supports full ansible-navigator.yml structure including:
    - ansible section (config overrides, playbook settings)
    - execution-environment object (enabled, image, pull-policy, environment-variables)
    - mode (stdout, json, yaml, interactive)
    - All other ansible-navigator.yml options
  When provided:
    - Plugin generates temporary ansible-navigator.yml file on local side
    - Uploads it to the target alongside playbooks
    - Sets ANSIBLE_NAVIGATOR_CONFIG environment variable in remote shell
    - Automatically sets EE temp dir defaults when execution-environment.enabled = true
    - Cleans up config file after execution
  Modern declarative ansible-navigator configuration via typed structs.
  When provided, the plugin generates a temporary ansible-navigator.yml file.
  This replaces the previous map[string]interface{} approach to ensure RPC serializability.
  Use block syntax in HCL:
    navigator_config {
      mode = "stdout"
      execution_environment {
        enabled = true
        image = "quay.io/ansible/creator-ee:latest"
      }
    }
