<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in provisioner/ansible-navigator-local/provisioner.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `command` (string) - The command to invoke ansible-navigator. Defaults to `ansible-navigator`.
  This must be the executable name or path only, without additional arguments.
  Use extra_arguments or play-level options for additional flags.
  Examples: "ansible-navigator", "/usr/local/bin/ansible-navigator", "~/bin/ansible-navigator"

- `ansible_navigator_path` ([]string) - Additional directories to prepend to PATH when locating and running ansible-navigator on the target.
  Entries are HOME-expanded locally and prepended to PATH in the remote shell command.
  Example: ["~/bin", "/opt/ansible/bin"]

- `extra_arguments` ([]string) - Extra arguments to pass to Ansible.
  These arguments _will not_ be passed through a shell and arguments should
  not be quoted. Usage example:
  
  ```json
     "extra_arguments": [ "--extra-vars", "Region={{user `Region`}} Stage={{user `Stage`}}" ]
  ```
  
  In certain scenarios where you want to pass ansible command line arguments
  that include parameter and value (for example `--vault-password-file pwfile`),
  from ansible documentation this is correct format but that is NOT accepted here.
  Instead you need to do it like `--vault-password-file=pwfile`.
  
  If you are running a Windows build on AWS, Azure, Google Compute, or OpenStack
  and would like to access the auto-generated password that Packer uses to
  connect to a Windows instance via WinRM, you can use the template variable
  
  ```build.Password``` in HCL templates or ```{{ build `Password`}}``` in
  legacy JSON templates. For example:
  
  in JSON templates:
  
  ```json
  "extra_arguments": [
     "--extra-vars", "winrm_password={{ build `Password`}}"
  ]
  ```
  
  in HCL templates:
  ```hcl
  extra_arguments = [
     "--extra-vars", "winrm_password=${build.Password}"
  ]
  ```

- `galaxy_command` (string) - The command to invoke ansible-galaxy. By default, this is
  `ansible-galaxy`.

- `version_check_timeout` (string) - Maximum time to wait for ansible-navigator version check to complete.
  Defaults to "60s". This prevents indefinite hangs when ansible-navigator
  is not properly configured or cannot be found.
  Format: duration string (e.g., "30s", "1m", "90s").
  Set to "0" to disable timeout (not recommended).

- `galaxy_force_install` (bool) - Force overwriting an existing role.
   Adds `--force` option to `ansible-galaxy` command. By default, this is
   `false`.

- `navigator_mode` (string) - Execution mode for ansible-navigator. Valid values: stdout, json, yaml, interactive.
  Defaults to "stdout" for non-interactive environments (Packer-safe).
  When set to "interactive" without a TTY, it automatically switches to "stdout".

- `execution_environment` (string) - The container image to use as the execution environment for ansible-navigator.
  Specifies which containerized environment runs the Ansible playbooks.
  When unset, ansible-navigator uses its default execution environment.
  Examples: "quay.io/ansible/creator-ee:latest", "my-registry.io/custom-ee:v1.0"

- `work_dir` (string) - Working directory for ansible-navigator execution.
  When specified, ansible-navigator will be executed from this directory.
  Defaults to the current working directory if not set.

- `keep_going` (bool) - Continue executing remaining plays even if one fails.
  When true, a play failure won't stop execution of subsequent plays.
  Default: false

- `structured_logging` (bool) - Enable structured JSON parsing and detailed task-level reporting.
  When true, parses JSON events from ansible-navigator and provides enhanced error reporting.
  Only effective when navigator_mode is set to "json".

- `log_output_path` (string) - Optional path to write a structured summary JSON file containing task results and failures.
  Only used when structured_logging is enabled.

- `verbose_task_output` (bool) - Include detailed task output in logs when using structured logging.
  Only effective when structured_logging is true.
  Default: false

- `play` ([]Play) - Array of play definitions supporting both playbooks and role FQDNs.
  Mutually exclusive with playbook_file.

- `requirements_file` (string) - Path to a unified requirements.yml file containing both roles and collections.
  Alternative to galaxy_file with enhanced support for modern Ansible requirements format.

- `collections_cache_dir` (string) - Directory to cache downloaded collections.
  Defaults to ~/.packer.d/ansible_collections_cache if not specified.

- `roles_cache_dir` (string) - Directory to cache downloaded roles. Similar to collections_cache_dir but for roles.
  Defaults to ~/.packer.d/ansible_roles_cache if not specified.

- `offline_mode` (bool) - When true, skip network operations for both collections and roles.
  Uses only locally cached dependencies.

- `force_update` (bool) - When true, always reinstall both collections and roles even if cached.

- `ansible_cfg` (map[string]map[string]string) - A map of Ansible configuration settings organized by INI sections.
  This automatically generates a temporary ansible.cfg file before provisioning begins.
  The file is uploaded to the remote machine and its path is passed via ANSIBLE_CONFIG.
  
  When execution_environment is set but ansible_cfg is not explicitly configured,
  the plugin automatically applies defaults to fix "Permission denied: /.ansible" errors:
    ansible_cfg = {
      defaults = {
        remote_tmp = "/tmp/.ansible/tmp"
        local_tmp  = "/tmp/.ansible-local"
      }
    }
  
  Example:
    ansible_cfg = {
      defaults = {
        remote_tmp      = "/tmp/.ansible/tmp"
        host_key_checking = "False"
      }
      ssh_connection = {
        pipelining = "True"
      }
    }

- `navigator_config` (map[string]interface{}) - Modern declarative ansible-navigator configuration via YAML file generation.
  Maps directly to ansible-navigator.yml schema structure.
  Supports full ansible-navigator.yml structure including:
    - ansible section (config overrides, playbook settings)
    - execution-environment object (enabled, image, pull-policy, environment-variables)
    - mode (stdout, json, yaml, interactive)
    - All other ansible-navigator.yml options
  When provided:
    - Plugin generates temporary ansible-navigator.yml file on local side
    - Uploads it to the target alongside playbooks
    - Sets ANSIBLE_NAVIGATOR_CONFIG environment variable in remote shell
    - Automatically sets EE temp dir defaults when execution-environment.enabled = true
    - Cleans up config file after execution
  When both navigator_config and legacy options present, navigator_config takes precedence.
