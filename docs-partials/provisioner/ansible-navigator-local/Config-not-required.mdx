<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in provisioner/ansible-navigator-local/provisioner.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `command` (string) - The command to invoke ansible-navigator. Defaults to `ansible-navigator`.
  This must be the executable name or path only, without additional arguments.
  Use extra_arguments or play-level options for additional flags.
  Examples: "ansible-navigator", "/usr/local/bin/ansible-navigator", "~/bin/ansible-navigator"

- `ansible_navigator_path` ([]string) - Additional directories to prepend to PATH when locating and running ansible-navigator on the target.
  Entries are HOME-expanded locally and prepended to PATH in the remote shell command.
  Example: ["~/bin", "/opt/ansible/bin"]

- `version_check_timeout` (string) - Maximum time to wait for ansible-navigator version check to complete.
  Defaults to "60s". This prevents indefinite hangs when ansible-navigator
  is not properly configured or cannot be found.
  Format: duration string (e.g., "30s", "1m", "90s").
  Set to "0" to disable timeout (not recommended).

- `galaxy_force_install` (bool) - Force overwriting an existing role.
   Adds `--force` option to `ansible-galaxy` command. By default, this is
   `false`.

- `work_dir` (string) - Working directory for ansible-navigator execution.
  When specified, ansible-navigator will be executed from this directory.
  Defaults to the current working directory if not set.

- `keep_going` (bool) - Continue executing remaining plays even if one fails.
  When true, a play failure won't stop execution of subsequent plays.
  Default: false

- `structured_logging` (bool) - Enable structured JSON parsing and detailed task-level reporting.
  When true, parses JSON events from ansible-navigator and provides enhanced error reporting.
  Only effective when navigator_mode is set to "json".

- `log_output_path` (string) - Optional path to write a structured summary JSON file containing task results and failures.
  Only used when structured_logging is enabled.

- `verbose_task_output` (bool) - Include detailed task output in logs when using structured logging.
  Only effective when structured_logging is true.
  Default: false

- `play` ([]Play) - Array of play definitions supporting both playbooks and role FQDNs.
  Mutually exclusive with playbook_file.

- `requirements_file` (string) - Path to a unified requirements.yml file containing both roles and collections.
  Alternative to galaxy_file with enhanced support for modern Ansible requirements format.

- `collections_cache_dir` (string) - Directory to cache downloaded collections.
  Defaults to ~/.packer.d/ansible_collections_cache if not specified.

- `roles_cache_dir` (string) - Directory to cache downloaded roles. Similar to collections_cache_dir but for roles.
  Defaults to ~/.packer.d/ansible_roles_cache if not specified.

- `offline_mode` (bool) - When true, skip network operations for both collections and roles.
  Uses only locally cached dependencies.

- `force_update` (bool) - When true, always reinstall both collections and roles even if cached.

- `navigator_config` (\*NavigatorConfig) - Modern declarative ansible-navigator configuration via YAML file generation.
  Maps directly to ansible-navigator.yml schema structure.
  Supports full ansible-navigator.yml structure including:
    - ansible section (config overrides, playbook settings)
    - execution-environment object (enabled, image, pull-policy, environment-variables)
    - mode (stdout, json, yaml, interactive)
    - All other ansible-navigator.yml options
  When provided:
    - Plugin generates temporary ansible-navigator.yml file on local side
    - Uploads it to the target alongside playbooks
    - Sets ANSIBLE_NAVIGATOR_CONFIG environment variable in remote shell
    - Automatically sets EE temp dir defaults when execution-environment.enabled = true
    - Cleans up config file after execution
  Modern declarative ansible-navigator configuration via typed structs.
  When provided, the plugin generates a temporary ansible-navigator.yml file.
  This replaces the previous map[string]interface{} approach to ensure RPC serializability.
  Use block syntax in HCL:
    navigator_config {
      mode = "stdout"
      execution_environment {
        enabled = true
        image = "quay.io/ansible/creator-ee:latest"
      }
    }
