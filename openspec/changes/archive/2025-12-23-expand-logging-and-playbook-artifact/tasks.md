# Tasks: Expand `navigator_config` logging and playbook-artifact

- [x] Identify the ansible-navigator documentation source/version to use as the schema reference for `logging` and `playbook-artifact` (target: ansible-navigator v3+).
  - Using the upstream ansible-navigator settings reference at <https://docs.ansible.com/projects/navigator/settings/> ("latest" docs; compatible with the repo's v3+ baseline goal).
- [x] Enumerate the full set of documented keys for `logging` and `playbook-artifact`, including nested structures and value types.
  - `logging`: `level` (string), `file` (string), `append` (bool)
  - `playbook-artifact`: `enable` (bool), `replay` (string path), `save-as` (string path)
- [x] Update both provisioners’ typed structs to add the missing fields:
  - `LoggingConfig`
  - `PlaybookArtifact`
- [x] Update YAML generation to emit all supported keys using the correct ansible-navigator YAML key names (hyphenated where required).
  - Verified via unit tests that `save-as` is emitted (not `save_as`) and that `logging.{level,file,append}` / `playbook-artifact.{enable,replay,save-as}` are present.
- [x] Update `//go:generate packer-sdc mapstructure-to-hcl2 ...` type lists if new nested structs are introduced.
  - No new nested structs were required for `logging` or `playbook_artifact`.
- [x] Regenerate HCL2 spec files (`make generate`).
- [x] Add unit tests that validate:
  - HCL decoding accepts the expanded blocks without “Unsupported argument” errors
  - Generated YAML includes the expected structure for representative configurations
  - Existing configurations still decode and produce equivalent YAML
- [x] Add/adjust a minimal example Packer template exercising at least one newly-supported logging and playbook-artifact field and ensure `packer validate` passes.
  - Updated `example/nested-navigator-config.pkr.hcl` to set `logging.append = true` and validated successfully via `packer validate`.
